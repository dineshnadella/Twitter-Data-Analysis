# Twitter-Data-Analysis
Classify good tweets and tweets which have sexist/racist/hate remarks based on content

# Dataset Information
We use and compare various methods for sentiment analysis on tweets (a binary classification problem). 
The training dataset is expected to be a csv file of type tweet_id,sentiment,tweet where the tweet_id is a unique integer identifying the tweet, sentiment is either 1 (positive) or 0 (negative), and tweet is the tweet enclosed in "". Similarly, the test dataset is a csv file of type tweet_id,tweet. Please note that csv headers are not expected and should be removed from the training and test datasets.

## 1) Understand the Problem Statement
The objective of this task is to detect hate speech in tweets. For the sake of simplicity, we say a tweet contains hate speech if it has a racist or sexist sentiment associated with it. So, the task is to classify racist or sexist tweets from other tweets.
### Note: The evaluation metric from this practice problem is F1-Score.
